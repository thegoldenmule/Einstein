Dislaimer: This is definitely a work in progress!This is a physics simulator that specializes in objects moving near the speed of light. Basic goals include:* COMPLETE - Lorentzian transform (Special Relativity) should be able to be toggled on and off.* COMPLETE - Each observer should keep their own clock relative to reference frame.* Reference frame should be interchangable between any observers.* Information should travel at light speed between observers.* In the far future, this should include basic gravity (General Relativity).It does NOT provide collision detection/resolution at near light speeds as that is not well understood even theoretically.
